6/9/2020 - Hopefully I will keep this updated to the best of my abilities. This will be my first entry, I plan on going into my findings online and what I am currently interested in and where I am spending my time.

Over the past month I have had a lot of time to study due to COVID-19. I have been focusing almost all of my efforts on solving HackTheBox challenges. The amount of information and different technologies I get to play with and mess with to figure stuff out is crazy. The other day one of the boxes required me to decompile a .NET application and read its source code in order to extract the encryption and decryption process used for the hashes I had found on the machine. After rewriting and tweaking the .NET code I was able to decrypt it. Took me some time and definitely was my first time decompiling an application I had used ILSpy to accomplish this. It was super fun and informative. That is why I am spending so much time on these HTB challenges to prepare myself for the coursework once I start the OSCP course. My current plans are to obtain at least 50% ownership of active machines on HackTheBox and then proceed with the OSCP course in preparation for the test. I am currently at 20% ownership on hackthebox.

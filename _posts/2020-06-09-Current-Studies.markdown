 6/22/2020 - Dealt with an interesting box today that required a lot of different skill sets I was unaware of at the time. The first one was using a CVE for a database program to connect it to a rogue database to dump the local.xml configuration. This proved quite difficult when attempting to set up a mysql server on linux, that was the biggest hurdle. After finally getting mysql to be launched with a Database and a table. I logged into the webserver and connected to my remote db and was able to use the exploit found in the program to dump a user's logs. Afterwards while trying to enumerate privescelation. I was sudoers permissions for setting environment variables. A crontab was running every 5 minutes for a script that did backups on /etc/passwd and various directories. The good part about this is that it used a python script for one of the dialog options in the script. I was able to hijack the IMPORT module and direct it to a script with the name of the module to get a reverse shell. This was another great learning box and I am glad I picked this one to do. I believe I brushed up on my sql skills as well which was valuable.

6/16/2020 - Worked on a Windows hackthebox machine today. A pretty informative box, involved the same c# decompilation in order to extract the method to decrypt an encrypted password. In this case the user password was inside of a sqlite db file, and the method that encrypted it used two static keys along with aes after taking the cleartext to Base64. This would have been secure had the encryption be dynamic rather than being able to find both static keys within the decompiled program. After using that given password I was able to get a shell with winrm. After some enumeration I was able to query AD to get information on a deleted admin account mentioned, after decoding that I was able to get root. Pretty interesting machine, learned a good amount about navigating and extracting nuggets of information from an anonymous RPC session. 

6/9/2020 - Hopefully I will keep this updated to the best of my abilities. This will be my first entry, I plan on going into my findings online and what I am currently interested in and where I am spending my time.

Over the past month I have had a lot of time to study due to COVID-19. I have been focusing almost all of my efforts on solving HackTheBox challenges. The amount of information and different technologies I get to play with and mess with to figure stuff out is crazy. The other day one of the boxes required me to decompile a .NET application and read its source code in order to extract the encryption and decryption process used for the hashes I had found on the machine. After rewriting and tweaking the .NET code I was able to decrypt it. Took me some time and definitely was my first time decompiling an application I had used ILSpy to accomplish this. It was super fun and informative. That is why I am spending so much time on these HTB challenges to prepare myself for the coursework once I start the OSCP course. My current plans are to obtain at least 50% ownership of active machines on HackTheBox and then proceed with the OSCP course in preparation for the test. I am currently at 20% ownership on hackthebox.
